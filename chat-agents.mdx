## Overview

Chat agents handle every written channel—Instagram DMs, Facebook Messenger, web chat widgets, SMS, WhatsApp, and email. We’ve already created the baseline agents for you. This guide shows how to safely tweak prompts, tools, integrations, and advanced settings so you can iterate without spinning up brand-new agents from scratch.

---

## Navigate Your Agents

### Step 1: Review the Agents Tab

Head to the **Agents** tab to view everything we’ve launched for you. Each tile reflects the campaigns our team maintains.

</Frame>

---

## Edit the Prompt

We seeded each agent’s prompt based on your onboarding brief. You can adjust wording, tone, or business rules directly in the editor—just follow the checklist below and remember to loop us in if the changes are significant.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/chat-agent-prompt.png" alt="Chat Agent Prompt Editor" />
</Frame>

### What to Include:

1. **Agent's Role** – Who should the agent represent? (e.g., "You are a friendly customer service representative for XYZ Company")
2. **Tone & Personality** – Formal, casual, enthusiastic, empathetic, etc.
3. **Goals** – What outcomes matter most? (qualify leads, book appointments, answer FAQs)
4. **Tool Usage Instructions** – Call out when to use connected tools, e.g.:

```
When a customer wants to book an appointment, call the book_appointment tool.
When you need to check inventory, use the check_stock tool.
```

<Tip>
  After editing, click **Save** and run a quick test conversation in the preview
  window. If you’re making a large strategic change, notify your strategist so
  we can review analytics after the update.
</Tip>

## Manage Tools and Automations

Tools give your chat agent superpowers—booking appointments, pushing data to CRMs, fetching live information, and more. You can enable/disable existing tools, update configuration values, and add new ones from the Tool Library.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom URL" icon="link">
    Use this when you need a bespoke workflow. Paste the webhook URL, select the method (GET, POST, etc.), add headers, and define the request/response formats. Test after saving to ensure the agent calls it successfully.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/chat-tool-custom-url.png" alt="Custom URL Tool" />
    </Frame>

    **Use Cases:**
    - Send lead data to your CRM

  Page, Instagram Business account) is authenticated and you’re ready for the
  agent to respond to all new conversations.
</Warning>

---

## Triggers for Campaigns & Keyword Flows

Triggers give you precise control over when your agent should respond. Tell us the keywords or flows you need and we’ll configure them.

### How Triggers Work:

1. We add a trigger word or phrase (e.g., "start", "book", "info")
2. The agent only wakes up when the incoming message matches the trigger
3. Messages that don't match the trigger are ignored by the AI

### Example Use Cases:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Instagram Reel Campaigns" icon="video">
    "DM me **START** to claim your free voucher!"
    
    The agent only responds to messages containing "start", ignoring casual comments and other DMs.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Keyword-Based Routing" icon="route">
  - **"book"** → Activate booking agent - **"support"** → Activate support agent
  - **"refund"** → Activate refund agent
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manual Control" icon="hand">
    Ask us to add a trigger so the AI stays quiet when you’re personally chatting with VIP clients.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Want full coverage? We’ll remove triggers so every message receives an instant
  response.
</Tip>

---

## Delay Settings

We use response delays to make conversations feel natural. Here’s how we tune them together.

### Configuration:

- **Minimum delay** – The shortest time before the agent responds
- **Maximum delay** – The longest time before the agent responds
- We randomize the actual delay between these values

### Recommended Starting Points:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Instant Response" icon="bolt">
  Min: 0 seconds Max: 5 seconds For time-sensitive inquiries or customer support
  </Card>

{" "}

<Card title="Human-like Response" icon="user">
  Min: 30 seconds Max: 120 seconds For conversations that should feel natural
  and unhurried
</Card>

{" "}

<Card title="Casual Response" icon="coffee">
  Min: 2 minutes Max: 10 minutes For lower-priority channels or when mimicking a
  busy human
</Card>

  <Card title="Business Hours Simulation" icon="clock">
    Min: 15 minutes Max: 60 minutes For email responses or non-urgent inquiries
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  **Why randomize?** A fixed delay (e.g., always 60 seconds) feels robotic.
  Random delays make the agent feel more human and authentic.
</Note>

---

## Knowledge Base

Keep the knowledge base fresh so the agent always references accurate information. You can add content yourself or ask us to handle larger updates.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload Files" icon="file-arrow-up">
    Click **Upload File**, drop in PDFs, DOCX, CSV, TXT, or Markdown files, and
    hit **Save**. The agent will ingest the content automatically. For sizeable
    handbooks, let us know so we can confirm token usage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scrape Websites" icon="globe">
    Use **Add Source → Website** to scrape live pages. Paste the URL, choose
    whether to follow links, and save. Great for product pages, help centres, or
    menus that change often.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Paste Text" icon="text">
    For quick updates, open **Add Source → Paste Text**, drop in the
    instructions, and save. Perfect for promotions, objection handling, or
    limited-time messaging.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  After adding material, run a quick test conversation to ensure the agent
  retrieves the new information. If you spot gaps or hallucinations, DM your
  strategist—we can adjust relevance weights or restructure the content.
</Tip>

---

## Agent Settings

You have access to all advanced settings. Feel free to tweak them as your campaigns evolve—just document what you change (we recommend noting it in Slack) so we can help monitor results.

### Time Zone

Open **Settings → General** and pick the time zone that matches your audience. This keeps statements like “tomorrow at 3pm” accurate. Update it any time you enter a new market.

---

### Model Selection

Choose the AI model that powers your agent. Use the dropdown in **Settings → Model** and click **Save**. Each option balances speed, reasoning, and cost differently.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/chat-settings-model.png" alt="Model Selection" />

## Embed Code

We provide the HTML snippet you can hand to your web team to embed the chat widget on any site.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/chat-embed-code.png" alt="Embed Code" />
</Frame>

### How to Use:

1. Copy the HTML snippet from the **Embed Code** section (or ask us to send it to your developer)
2. Add it to your website's HTML just before the closing `</body>` tag
3. The chat widget will appear automatically once published

### Example Code:

```html
<script
  src="https://app.callaidan.com/widget/chat.js"
  data-agent-id="6531f2d6-7067-458b-a782-2cae809a7dc6"
  data-open="false"
  async
></script>
```

<Note>
  Copy the snippet directly from the agent’s **Embed Code** section so the
  `data-agent-id` value matches the agent you’re using.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Customization:** Want it on-brand? Let us know and we’ll provide CSS or
  coordinate directly with your developer.
</Tip>

---

## Initial Message

Set the first message contacts see when they open the chat widget. Update the text inside **Embed Settings → Initial Message** and click **Save**.

### Example Initial Messages:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Friendly Greeting" icon="hand-wave">
    "👋 Hi there! How can I help you today?"
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Specific Offer" icon="gift">
  "🎉 Welcome! Ask me about our special promotion—20% off all services this
  week!"
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Lead Qualification" icon="clipboard-question">
  "Hi! I'm here to help you find the perfect solution. What brings you here
  today?"
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Booking Focus" icon="calendar-check">
    "Ready to book your appointment? I can check availability and get you scheduled in seconds!"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  The initial message only appears in the **web chat embed**. Other platforms
  (Instagram, SMS, etc.) start with the user’s message instead.
</Note>

---

## Interrupt Mode

Interrupt Mode lets your human team take over a conversation instantly. Toggle it under **Settings → Behaviour** whenever you need to change availability.

### How It Works:

When **Interrupt Mode** is enabled:

1. ✅ The AI agent handles all conversations automatically
2. 👤 A human team member sends a manual message in GoHighLevel
3. 🛑 The AI agent is **immediately interrupted** for that contact
4. 🙋 The human takes over the conversation
5. 🤖 The AI stays silent unless manually reactivated

### When to Enable:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Enable Interrupt Mode" icon="toggle-on">
    **Best for most use cases:** - Gives your team flexibility to jump into conversations - VIP clients get personal attention - Complex situations get routed to humans instantly - You can hand conversations back to the AI when you’re ready
  </Card>

  <Card title="Disable Interrupt Mode" icon="toggle-off">
    **When you want full automation:** - Always-on support channels -
    After-hours campaigns - High-volume, low-touch scenarios - Controlled testing of agent performance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  We recommend enabling Interrupt Mode during business hours so your team can
  step in, then disabling it after hours for full automation.
</Tip>

---

## Test & Publish Safely

1. Use **Test Agent** inside the editor to run through the scenario you just updated.
2. If the change touches external systems, place a live test (or have us do it) to confirm logs, tools, and delays behave as expected.
3. Monitor the first few conversations in Call Logs. If anything feels off, revert the edit or message us immediately.

{" "}

{" "}

<Accordion title="Agent Giving Wrong Answers" icon="message-xmark">

{" "}

<Accordion title="Tools Not Working" icon="wrench">
  Reopen the tool, confirm credentials/API keys are current, and run a manual
  test. Provide the contact and timestamp if you need us to audit logs.
</Accordion>

{" "}

{" "}

<Accordion title="Response Timing Off" icon="gauge">
  Adjust the minimum/maximum delay in **Settings → Behaviour**. If responses
  still feel unnatural, note the channel + scenario and we’ll help tune it
  further.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Interrupt Mode Not Switching" icon="hand">
    Confirm the toggle state, make sure the manual message was sent from a human profile (not the AI), and refresh the thread. If it continues, ping us so we can review permissions.
