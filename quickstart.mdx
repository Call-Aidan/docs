## Welcome to Aidan

This guide shows how our done-with-you process works, what to expect inside your dashboard, and how to request updates from the Aidan team. Use it as a companion to strategy calls so you always know where to review, adjust, and approve campaigns.

<Note>
  Your Aidan success manager will share workspace access once onboarding is
  complete. Need credentials resent? Email
  [support@callaidan.com](mailto:support@callaidan.com) and weâ€™ll take care of
  it for you.
</Note>

## Partnering With Us

<Steps>
  <Step title="Kickoff & Workspace Tour">
    Meet your strategist, align on goals, and review the dashboards we maintain
    on your behalf. Weâ€™ll confirm integrations, telephony, and compliance during
    this call.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Blueprint & Build">
    Our team drafts conversation blueprints, configures voice or chat agents,
    and shares preview links. Youâ€™ll focus on feedbackâ€”tone, offers, FAQsâ€”while
    we handle the updates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch, Monitor & Iterate">
    Once you approve, we launch campaigns and monitor performance. Use this doc
    to see where transcripts, scoring, and tooling live so you can request
    optimizations anytime.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Key Metrics" icon="chart-line">

    conversations, and status breakdowns. We review these numbers in your
    recurring strategy sessions and flag outliers proactively.
  </Accordion>

    See every interaction we drive. We can import audiences for you or connect
    live syncsâ€”just let us know which CRM segments to target.

    metrics, helping you optimize your agents over time.
  </Accordion>

## Connect GoHighLevel (Optional)

Aidan offers native GoHighLevel integration to seamlessly sync contacts, trigger workflows, and manage conversations within your CRM. We configure the connection for you; this section simply explains what weâ€™ll have in place.

<Note>
  The GoHighLevel integration is optional but highly recommended if your team
  uses GHL for sales or service automation.
</Note>

### Setting Up Your Integration

## Collaborating on Your Agents

Agents are the core of Aidan. We handle the configuration end-to-endâ€”use the checklists below to share updates, assets, or preferences so we can implement them quickly.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="ðŸŽ¤ Voice Agents">
    Perfect for inbound receptionist duties or outbound calling campaigns. Handle calls 24/7 with natural conversation.

    ### Step 1: Set Your Agent Prompt

    The **Prompt** is the backbone of your agent's behavior â€” what it says, how it handles objections, and what outcomes it aims for.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Describe the Goal">
        Share the objective with your strategist (e.g., "Qualify solar leads and book appointments"). We translate that into a full prompt using refined frameworks.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Review & Approve">
        Weâ€™ll send you a preview call or transcript. Provide tone tweaks or objection handling notes and weâ€™ll update the prompt for you.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Step 2: Add Tools

    We wire in the right actionsâ€”let us know which systems you want involved:

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Calendar Booking" icon="calendar">
        Book appointments via Cal.com or GoHighLevel calendars
      </Card>
      <Card title="Send SMS" icon="message">
        Send follow-up text messages during or after calls
      </Card>
      <Card title="Send Email" icon="envelope">
        Trigger email sequences based on call outcomes
      </Card>
      <Card title="CRM Actions" icon="database">
        Update contact fields, add tags, or trigger workflows
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    ### Step 3: Build Your Knowledge Base

    We curate knowledge sources so answers stay accurate. Send us the assets we should include:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Upload Files" icon="file">
        Send PDFs, documents, or text files with product info, FAQs, or pricing details and weâ€™ll import them.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Scrape Websites" icon="globe">
        Share website URLs and our team will scrape and format the content using Firecrawl.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Paste Text" icon="text">
        Provide any custom instructions or messaging in plain text and weâ€™ll add it to the knowledge base.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

    ### Step 4: Configure Voice Settings

      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Select Model" icon="brain">
        Weâ€™ll pick the model that balances speed, reasoning, and cost for your campaignâ€”and explain the trade-offs during review.

      <Accordion title="Background Sound" icon="volume">
        Want office ambience or a silent line? Tell us and weâ€™ll make it feel natural.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="First Message" icon="comment">
        Provide the greeting or intro you prefer; weâ€™ll script and implement it.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Call Forwarding" icon="phone-arrow-up-right">
        Share escalation paths and phone numbers so we can configure intelligent transfers on your behalf.

  <Tab title="ðŸ’¬ Chat Agents">
    Deploy on your website, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, or other messaging platforms for instant responses.

    ### Step 1: Set Your Agent Prompt
