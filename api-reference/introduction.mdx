## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.callaidan.com

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using an `Authorization` header with your API key. Note that you should pass the API key directly without the 'Bearer' prefix.

```bash
Authorization: your-api-key-here
```

- **Company API Key**: Used for company-level operations including:

  - Agent management (agents, files, integrations, tools)
  - Tool instances
  - Contacts and conversations
  - Call logs, chat logs, and transcripts
  - Company settings, staff, and phone numbers

You can find your API keys in your dashboard settings. Make sure to use the correct API key type for the endpoints you're accessing.

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.callaidan.com/agent/list \
  -H "Authorization: your-company-api-key-here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
