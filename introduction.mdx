## Welcome to Aidan

Aidan designs, deploys, and maintains conversation AI for your brand. We handle the heavy lifting—strategy, scripting, tooling, and optimization—so you can focus on results instead of configuration screens.

Every engagement includes a dedicated strategist, managed launch plans, and ongoing performance reviews. We support 100+ languages, 1,000+ voices, and up to 10,000 calls per day, giving your team enterprise-scale automation without the DIY overhead.
