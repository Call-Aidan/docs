  reliability and features) - üåç **International traffic?** Use Vonage
  (per-second billing saves money) - üí∞ **Cost-conscious international?** Use
  Telnyx + Twilio combo (best rates in AU/UK/NZ/Europe)
</Tip>

## Choosing a Provider

Compare the three carriers to find the best fit for your use case.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Twilio" icon="/images/twilio.svg">
    **Best for:** United States (and Canada)

    ### Strengths

    - ‚úÖ Quick, self-serve setup‚Äîbuy numbers in minutes
    - ‚úÖ High concurrency limits‚Äîperfect for large campaigns
    - ‚úÖ Built-in voicemail detection (saves wasted agent talk-time)
    - ‚úÖ **Verified Caller ID** lets you mask calls with a client's existing phone number
    - ‚úÖ Direct GoHighLevel SMS integration‚Äîsame number for calls and texts

    ### Weak Points

    - ‚ùå Charges **by the minute** (rounded up), so a 9-second voicemail costs a full minute
    - ‚ùå Non-US pricing is steep‚Äîabout **7¬¢ USD per minute** in Australia

    <Tip>
      **Rule of thumb:** If the traffic is US-centric, stick with Twilio every time.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Vonage" icon="/images/vonage.png">
    **Best for:** Non-US regions where per-second billing matters

    ### Strengths

    - ‚úÖ **Bills per second**‚Äîa 30-second call costs half a minute
    - ‚úÖ Slightly cheaper headline rates than Twilio outside the US

    ### Weak Points

    - ‚ùå No native voicemail detection (Aidan uses its own transcript-based fallback)
    - ‚ùå No verified caller IDs
    - ‚ùå **On-boarding is manual:** email a rep, fill in forms, wait for approval
    - ‚ùå No GoHighLevel SMS tie-in, so you'll juggle separate SMS and voice numbers

    <Note>
      **When to use:** Mid-size international campaigns where per-second pricing outweighs the admin hassle.
    </Note>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Telnyx" icon="/images/telnyx.png">
    **Best for:** International markets (AU, UK, NZ, Europe) when cost is king and you still want Caller ID masking

    ### Strengths

    - ‚úÖ **Significantly cheaper than Twilio** in most international markets (40-60% savings)
    - ‚úÖ Supports **verified caller IDs**‚Äîpair it with a Twilio SMS number for a "one-number" experience
    - ‚úÖ Modern dashboard, good documentation
    - ‚úÖ Competitive rates in AU, UK, NZ, and European countries

    ### Weak Points

    - ‚ùå Charges by the minute (no per-second savings)
    - ‚ùå Occasional reliability quirks: sudden number blocks, quirky concurrency caps
    - ‚ùå No built-in voicemail detection
    - ‚ùå No direct GoHighLevel SMS integration (hence the Twilio-plus-Telnyx combo)

    ### Practical Hybrid Stack

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Twilio for SMS + Inbound">
        Buy a Twilio number ‚Üí connect to GoHighLevel for SMS + inbound voice
      </Step>
      <Step title="Telnyx for Outbound">
        Buy a Telnyx number ‚Üí set Twilio number as a verified caller ID
      </Step>
      <Step title="Save on Costs">
        Make outbound calls via Telnyx and save 40-60% on international rates
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    **Works great in:** AU, UK, NZ, and most European countries

## Twilio Setup

Twilio is the gold standard for US/Canada traffic. We can complete the setup on your behalf with delegated access; if you prefer to handle it internally, follow these steps and share the credentials with us afterwards.

### 1. Create (or Open) a Dedicated Workspace

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log In">
    Visit [console.twilio.com](https://console.twilio.com)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Workspace">
    Open the account switcher in the top navigation ‚Üí select **Create new
    account**
  </Step>

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/telephony-twilio-workspace.png"
    alt="Twilio Account Selector"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  If Twilio shows multiple "regions", always leave it on **US1** so Aidan can
  reach the logs.
</Tip>

---

### 2. Build the Regulatory "Bundle" (If Required)

Many countries require proof-of-business before you can purchase phone numbers. Twilio calls this a "regulatory bundle."

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/telephony-twilio-regulatory.png"
    alt="Twilio Regulatory Bundle"
  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  **US/Canada toll-free and local numbers** typically don't require bundles.
  **Mobile numbers** in most countries (including AU, UK, NZ) do require
  compliance documentation.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Regulatory Compliance">
    In the left menu choose **Phone Numbers** ‚Üí **Regulatory Compliance**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Bundle">
    Click **Create Bundle** and fill in: - **Country:** Select your target
    country - **Number Type:** Mobile, Local, or Toll-Free - **Business Type:**
    Independent software vendor (or appropriate category)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Documents">
    Twilio typically asks for: - **Business name** - **Business address** -
    **Business registration number** (ABN for AU, EIN for US, Companies House
    for UK, NZBN for NZ) **Accepted documents:** - Utility bills - Lease
    agreements - Business registration certificates - Tax documents Each file
    must show at least two of the required data points; upload multiple files if
    needed. **Registry Links:** - [ASIC
    (Australia)](https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/) - [Companies House
    (UK)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house) - [New
    Zealand Companies Office](https://www.companiesoffice.govt.nz/)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit and Wait">
    Submit; approval usually takes 24-48 hours depending on the country
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 3. Buy a Phone Number

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Buy a Number">
    After the bundle is approved (or immediately for US/Canada), go to **Phone
    Numbers** ‚Üí **Buy a number**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter by Country and Capabilities">
    Filter for your **target country** and **Capabilities = Voice & SMS**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Number">
    Select a number that matches your needs: - **Mobile** (AU: 614, UK: 447, NZ:

### 4. A2P Registration (US SMS Only)

If you're sending SMS messages to US numbers, you **must** register for A2P (Application-to-Person) messaging. This is a US regulation to reduce spam.

<Warning>
  **Required for US SMS:** Without A2P registration, your SMS messages to US
  numbers will be blocked or heavily throttled (limited to ~5 messages per
  minute).
</Warning>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/telephony-twilio-a2p.png" alt="A2P Registration" />
</Frame>

#### What is A2P?

A2P (Application-to-Person) registration is required by US carriers for business SMS messaging. It verifies that you're a legitimate business sending approved content.

**Two Options:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Standard Registration (Recommended)" icon="shield-check">
    **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks  
    **Cost:** ~$15-50 one-time fee  
    **Throughput:** Up to 4,500 messages per minute

    **Requirements:**
    - Business EIN (Employer Identification Number)
    - Business website
    - Business address
    - Description of your SMS use case
    - Sample message templates

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Navigate to A2P Registration">
        Twilio Console ‚Üí **Messaging** ‚Üí **Regulatory Compliance** ‚Üí **A2P 10DLC**
      </Step>
      <Step title="Register Your Business">
        Submit your business information and EIN
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create Brand">
        Describe your brand and how you'll use SMS
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create Campaign">
        Define your use case (appointment reminders, customer service, marketing, etc.)

        Submit sample message templates
      </Step>
      <Step title="Wait for Approval">
        Approval typically takes 4-6 weeks. You'll receive email updates on progress
      </Step>
      <Step title="Assign Numbers">
        Once approved, assign your US numbers to the campaign
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Tip>
      Start the A2P process **immediately** after buying your number. The 4-6 week wait is unavoidable, so don't delay!
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Low Volume (Quick Start)" icon="gauge-simple-min">
    **Timeline:** Instant  
    **Cost:** Free  
    **Throughput:** Only 5-10 messages per minute

    If you're just testing or sending very low volumes, you can skip full A2P registration. However, your messages will be heavily throttled.

    <Warning>
      **Not suitable for production:** Low volume limits make this impractical for real campaigns. Only use for testing or tiny-scale operations.
    </Warning>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Non-US Numbers

If you're **not** sending SMS to US numbers (e.g., AU ‚Üí AU, UK ‚Üí UK), you can skip A2P registration entirely. It's only required for US SMS traffic.

<Note>
  **International SMS:** Other countries have their own regulations, but most
  don't require pre-registration like the US does. Always check local
  requirements for your target market.
</Note>

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/telephony-twilio-caller-id.png"
    alt="Twilio Verified Caller ID"
  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  **Important:** Verified IDs work for **outbound only**; inbound calls still
  land on the Twilio number.
</Note>

---

## Vonage Setup

Vonage bills by the second and can be cheaper than Twilio outside the US, but the onboarding is more manual. Follow these steps to secure a number and connect it to Aidan.

### 1. Log In and Fund the Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit Dashboard">
    Visit [dashboard.nexmo.com](https://dashboard.nexmo.com) (same portal,
    simply re-branded as Vonage)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Balance">
    Add a small balance‚ÄîVonage won't let you request numbers on a ¬£0 wallet
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

### 2. Request a Phone Number

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Buy Numbers">
    In the left sidebar, click **Phone Numbers** ‚Üí **Buy Numbers**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search for Number">Choose the target country and search</Step>
  <Step title="Request (Not Buy)">
    Click **Request**; instead of instant purchase, the portal creates a ticket
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Documents">

  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Telnyx Setup

Telnyx often offers lower per-minute rates than Twilio in many international markets (especially AU, UK, and Europe), but it lacks GoHighLevel SMS integration and native voicemail detection. The current Aidan workflow uses Telnyx via SIP, masking outbound calls with your existing Twilio number so inbound and SMS continue to flow through Twilio.

<Card title="Recommended Flow" icon="lightbulb">
  Keep Twilio connected for inbound voice and SMS ‚Üí Add Telnyx via SIP for outbound calling ‚Üí Mask the Telnyx calls with your Twilio caller ID for a seamless experience.
</Card>

---

### Step 1 ‚Äì Secure a Twilio SMS / Inbound Line

If you haven‚Äôt already, make sure you have a Twilio number handling inbound voice and SMS. Connect it to Aidan and GoHighLevel so all messaging stays in sync.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Buy Twilio Number">
    Purchase a Twilio number in your target country, plug the **SID & Auth Token** into Aidan, and connect it to GoHighLevel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign to Your Agent">
    Keep this number for **inbound calls** and **all texting**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

### Step 2 ‚Äì Buy a Telnyx Outbound Line

</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/telephony-telnyx-aidan-sip.png" alt="Telnyx SIP in Aidan" />
</Frame>

### Result

‚úÖ All outbound calls travel via Telnyx (typically 40-60% cheaper than Twilio in most markets)  
‚úÖ The callee's phone displays the familiar Twilio number  
‚úÖ Inbound calls and SMS still hit GoHighLevel through Twilio

**Estimated Savings:**

- **Australia:** ~3.3¬¢/min vs ~7¬¢/min (save ~50%)
- **UK:** ~2¬¢/min vs ~3¬¢/min (save ~33%)
- **Europe:** ~2-3¬¢/min vs ~4-5¬¢/min (save ~40%)

<Tip>
  **Ideal for international teams!** You get Twilio's reliability for SMS and
  inbound, with Telnyx's pricing for outbound calls. The savings really add up
  on high-volume campaigns.
</Tip>

### Cost-Control Reminders

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Per-Minute Billing" icon="clock">
    Telnyx charges **by the minute** (unlike Vonage's per-second billing). A 61-second call costs 2 minutes.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Test Concurrency" icon="gauge">
  Telnyx occasionally rate-limits new numbers. If calls start failing, raise a
  support ticket to increase limits.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Watch for Blocks" icon="ban">
  Keep an eye on "number blocked" errors mid-campaign. Swap a fresh Telnyx
  number if needed.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Your Stack" icon="file-lines">
    With a multi-provider setup (Twilio + Telnyx), document which number does what so your team doesn't get confused.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with One Provider" icon="seedling">
    Don't try to set up all three at once. Pick the best fit for your primary market and master it first.
    
    - **US/Canada clients?** Twilio
    - **International clients (per-second billing)?** Vonage
    - **Cost-conscious international (AU/UK/NZ/Europe)?** Telnyx + Twilio combo
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Separate Workspaces per Client" icon="users">
  Create dedicated Twilio workspaces or clearly labeled numbers (Vonage/Telnyx)
  for each client. This keeps billing, reporting, and troubleshooting clean.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Test Before Going Live" icon="flask">
  Always send test calls before launching campaigns: 1. Test inbound and
  outbound 2. Verify caller ID displays correctly 3. Check SMS delivery (if
  applicable) 4. Confirm call quality and latency
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Monitor Your Balance" icon="wallet">
  Set up billing alerts in your provider dashboard. Running out of credits
  mid-campaign is embarrassing and costly.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Your Verified Caller IDs" icon="clipboard">
    Keep a spreadsheet of which client uses which caller ID, especially if you're managing multiple masked setups.

    - Double-check credentials (SID, Auth Token, API Key) are correct
    - Refresh the Aidan page
    - For Twilio, confirm you're using the credentials for the intended workspace
    - For Telnyx SIP, verify the SIP domain is correct (`sip.telnyx.com` or `192.76.120.10`)
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Calls Failing to Connect" icon="phone-xmark">
  **Problem:** Outbound calls aren't connecting. **Solutions:** - **Check
  balance:** Ensure your provider account has sufficient funds - **Verify number
  status:** Some numbers need activation or compliance approval - **Test with a
  different number:** Rule out number-specific issues - **Check concurrency
  limits:** You may have hit your max simultaneous calls - **Review error
  logs:** Aidan shows detailed error messages in Call Logs
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Caller ID Not Displaying Correctly" icon="id-card">
  **Problem:** The wrong number is showing on outbound calls. **Solutions:** -
  **Twilio:** Verify the caller ID is properly verified in Verified Caller IDs -
  **Telnyx:** Check the Caller ID Override is set correctly in the SIP trunk -
  **Both:** Ensure you've selected the correct caller ID in Aidan when setting
  up the campaign
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="SMS Not Working" icon="message-xmark">
  **Problem:** Text messages aren't sending or receiving. **Solutions:** -
  **Twilio only:** SMS doesn't work with Vonage or Telnyx in GoHighLevel -
  Verify the Twilio number has SMS capability enabled - Check that the number is
  properly connected to GoHighLevel - Ensure you have A2P 10DLC registration if
  sending to US numbers
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="High Latency or Poor Call Quality" icon="signal">
  **Problem:** Calls have delays or sound choppy. **Solutions:** - **Check your
  internet connection:** Voice requires stable bandwidth - **Test from a
  different location:** Rule out local network issues - **Try a different SIP
  region:** For Telnyx, switch to a closer POP - **Contact provider support:**
  There may be routing issues on their end
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regulatory Bundle Rejected" icon="file-circle-xmark">
    **Problem:** Twilio rejected your compliance documents.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Ensure documents show at least 2 of 3 required data points (name, address, registration number)
    - Use recent documents (under 3 months old)
    - Make sure text is legible (no blurry photos)
    - Upload multiple documents if one doesn't cover all requirements
    - Check the rejection email for specific issues
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="A2P Registration Stuck or Rejected" icon="shield-xmark">
    **Problem:** Your A2P 10DLC registration is taking too long or was rejected.
    
    **Solutions:**
    
    **If Stuck (over 6 weeks):**
    - Contact Twilio support with your campaign ID
    - Check for any pending actions in the A2P dashboard
    - Verify your business EIN is valid and matches official records
    
    **If Rejected:**
    - Review the rejection reason carefully
    - Common issues:
      - Sample messages look like spam or scams
      - Business website doesn't match your description
      - Use case is unclear or too broad
      - EIN doesn't match business name
    - Revise your campaign description to be more specific
    - Provide clearer sample message templates
    - Resubmit with corrections
    
    <Tip>
      **Pro Tip:** Be very specific in your campaign description. Instead of "marketing messages," say "appointment reminders and booking confirmations for dental practice patients."
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="US SMS Still Throttled After A2P" icon="gauge-simple-min">
    **Problem:** SMS messages are still slow even after A2P approval.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Verify your phone number is actually assigned to the approved campaign
    - Check campaign status‚Äîit may show "approved" but still be processing
    - Allow 24-48 hours after approval for full throughput to activate
    - Review your campaign's assigned throughput tier (some use cases get lower limits)
    - Contact Twilio if throttling persists beyond 48 hours
